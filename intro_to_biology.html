<h2><b>Chemistry of Life</b></h2>
<h3><u>Pre-Class Learning Goals</u></h3>

<body>
<ul>
	<li>Describe the structure of an atom</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The atom has protons, neutrons and electrons.</li>
		</ul> 
 
	<li>Define and relate the terms electronegativity and polarity</li> 
		<ul>
 			<li><b>Electronegativity</b> is defined as how much atoms attract each other</li>
 			<li><b>Polarity</b> is defined as how the electrons are shared within a molecule. A <b>non-polar</b> molecule has a symmetric appearance. This is because all the atoms have the same (or same-ish) electronegativity level. A <b>polar</b> molecule (like H<sub>2</sub>O) has an uneven appearance. This is because the atoms in the molcule have different levels of electronegativity.</li> 
<img class="grey-border" src="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Partial-negative-positive-charge.jpg" alt="Image of Water Molecule" style="float:right;width:420px; height:420px;">
  		</ul>

	<li>Explain how nonpolar and polar covalent bonds are formed between atoms</li> 
		<ul>
			<li>Refer to the previous learning outcome </il>
  		</ul>
 
	<li>Explain how the potential energy of two atoms changes as they form or break a bond</li> 
		<ul>
			<li>Recall the Relative Potential Energy / Internuclear Distance Graph!</li>
			<li>The lowest potential energy occurs when the atoms are the happiest. The stronger the bond, the further down the graph sweeps.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(To see bond strengths and how they relate, view the 2nd to last learning outcome in this section)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
 
	<li>Describe each type of chemical bond and intermolecular force: nonpolar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals’ forces</li> 
		<ul>
			<li><b>Covalent bonds</b> are the strongest (since we are thinking about ionic bonds in H<sub>2</sub>O), and they cannot occur with a metal</li>
			<li><b>Ionic bonds</b> are the 2nd strongest bonds, and they occur between any metal and non-metal</li>
			<li><b>Hydrogen bonds</b> are the 3rd strongest. This is the bond that occurs between ANY polar molecules. Since polar molecules tend to have hydrogen, this is the name.</li>
			<li><b>van der Waals' forces</b> are the weakest of the four. They occur to the random movement of electrons and can occur to anything/anywhere.</li>
		</ul>
 	<li>Define the terms “hydrophilic” and “hydrophobic"</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Good to know: <i>Polar bonds</i> are generally hydrophilic, and <i>non-polar bonds</i> are generally hydrophobic. </li>
		</ul>
</ul> 
</body>
<h3><u>Midterm Goals</u></h3>

<body>
<ul>
	<li>Identify the number of covalent bonds formed by H, C, O, and N</li>
		<ul>
			<li>H forms 1 covalent bond</li>
			<li>O forms 2 covalent bond</li>
			<li>N forms 3 covalent bond</li>
			<li>C forms 4 covalent bonds</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Compare and contrast the relative electronegativities of H, C, O, and N <b>PLEASE CHECK THIS INFO</b></li> 
		<ul>
			<li>H and C have lower electronegativity</li>
			<li>O and N have higher electronegativity</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Determine whether a molecule is likely to be polar or nonpolar based on its chemical structure and the relative electronegativity of its atoms</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I normally don't codone memorization, but this seems like a good time to memorize the electronegativities from the previous learning outcome and use it. For example, if H and O are bonded, then it must be polar because of the uneven electronegativity and therefore unequal bond sharing.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Relate the potential energy change of an atomic interaction to its “strength”</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Refer to the question about bond strength. Covalent bonds have the highest bond strength, and the lowest potential energy (because it would take a lot of energy to take them out of their 'happy place.' The highest potential energy would then be van der Waals because they are the weakest of the four bonds.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Compare the relative strengths of bonds and electrostatic interactions and relate these strengths to the amount of energy required to break them</li>
		<ul>
			<li> As seen by the graph, the stronger the bond is, the lower its potential energy is.</li>
			<li>This is because it'll take more energy to break it, which is equal to the distance between the min and the x-axis.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Determine whether a molecule is able to participate in hydrogen bonding with itself or another molecule based on its chemical structure and relative electronegativity of its atoms<b>REVIEW THIS WORKSHEET</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>A molecule can only participate in hydrogen bonding if it is <i>hydrophilic</i> and therefore must be <i>polar</i></li>
			<li>This means the bonds should be unevenly shared.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Determine whether a molecule is likely to be hydrophilic or hydrophobic based on its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water</li>
		<ul>
			<li>As long as the molecule is polar and has hydrogen, then it's hydrophilic. Otherwise, assume hydrophobic.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
</body>

<h2><b>Cell Organization</b></h2>
<h3><u>Pre-Class Learning Goals</u></h3>
<body>
<ul>
	<li>Compare and contrast the organization of prokaryotic/eukaryotic cells and plant/animal cells</li>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Prokaryotic cells</b>do NOT have a nucleus</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The genetic material is free floating in the cell</li>
			<li>DNA is in the <b>nucleoid</b>, which is a discrete <i>region</i></li>
			<li>In bacteria, this is a <b>plasmid</b>, or a circular ring of genetic material</li>
			<li>Prokaryotic Cells are considerably smaller than eukaryotic cells</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Eukaryotic cells</b>have a nucleus</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Includes all plant, animal, fungi, etc cells</li>
			<li>The <b>nucleus</b>allows for transcription and translation, and more advanced processes</li>
			<li>Inside, there are other membrane-bound organelles, so there are specialized compartments for different functions.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Animal cells</b> versus <b>plant cells</b></li>
			<ul>
			<li>Plant cells have <b>chloroplasts</b> (for sun energy).</li>
			<li>Plants also have <b>cell wall</b> and do not use a mitochondra</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>Define the terms organelle, cytoplasm, and cytosol</li>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Organelle</b> is a compartment inside a eukaryotic cell which is membrane bound.</li>
		<li><b>Cytoplasm</b> is technically defined as the contents in the cell that are not the nucleus.</li>
		<li><b>Cytosol</b> is technically defined as the jelly environment that the nucleus and organelles live in.</li>
		<li>However, BOTH cytoplasm and cytosol just mean the jelly substance in this course!</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Describe the function of common eukaryotic organelles: mitochondrion, chloroplast, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, and vacuole</li>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Mitochondrion</b> is the iconic powerhouse, which makes ATP from sugar.</li>
		<li><b>Chloroplast</b> is only in PLANT CELLS and it makes sunlight into energy</li>
		<li><b>Nucleus</b> is the boss of the cells (gives directions, has DNA, tells cells when to divide, protein synthesis, etc)</li>
		<li><b>Endoplasmic reticulum</b> is involved in the synthesis of proteins and lipids</li>
		<li><b>Golgi apparatus</b> modifies proteins and lipids..the mail room one.</li>
		<li><b>Lysosome</b> is the trash can, and it breaks down the macromolecules.</li>
		<li><b>Vacuole</b> is what helps plant cells maintain turgor pressure (stiffness)</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Identify the structures of different lipids: triglycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Skipped for now.
		</ul>
	<li>Differentiate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Generally discussed at the same time as <b>phospholipids</b> (which have a <b>hydrocarbon</b> chain and a <b>carboxyl</b> group head.</li>
		<li><b>Saturated fatty acid</b> is when there are NO KINKS. It's straight.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>This is more viscous, or has a HARDER time moving around due to higher levels of van der Waals forces it faces</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Unsaturated fatty acids</b> DO have kinks, and they're bent! (due to double bonds)</li>
			<ul>
			<li>They are more fluid because they experience less van der Waals forces.</li>
			<li>These turn into liquid faster and at lower temperatures</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>Describe the structure of the plasma membrane and the different ways that proteins can be associated with the lipid bilayer</li>
		<ul>
		<li>The plasma membrane is FLUID and has phospholipids.</li>
		<li>There are two types of proteins (based on how they integrate with the lipid bilayer</li>
			<ol>
			<li><b>Integral membrane proteins</b> are permanent and stretch throughout the whole cell membrane, touching both sides.</li>
			<li><b>Peripheral membrane proteins</b> are stuck on one side or the other, and cannot switch sides (due to the hydrophobic tendencies of the tails. They are associated with the membrane through weak noncovalent interactions.</li>. 
			</ol>
		</ul>
		
	<li>Define and term diffusion</li>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Diffusion</b> is the random movement of molecules.</li>
		<li>If there is a difference in concentrations, then diffusion is the net movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Explain how the chemical properties of a phospholipid bilayer allow it to act as a semipermeable membrane</li>
		<ul>
		<li>The phospholipid bilayer has both hydrophobilic and hydrophilic sides, and it is tightly packed (which prevents large molecules from passing through easily)</li>
		<li>The different sides prevent charged molecules from moving through easily. </li>
		<li>However, hydrophobic molecules have an easier time</li>
		<li>From least likely to get through, to most likely, it's charge, size and then polarity</li>
		<li>Cell membranes are permeable to H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
		</ul>

	<li>Define and relate the terms tonicity, osmosis, hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic</li>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Tonicity</b> is the ability of extracellular solution to make water move out of cell.</li>
		<li><b>Osmosis</b> is the movement of water through means of diffusion.</li>
		<li><b>Hypertonic</b> is when water moves out of the cell because the solute solution is higher on the outside.</li>
		<li><b>Hypotonic</b> is when water moves into the cell because solute solution is higher on the inside.</li>
		<li><b>Isotonic</b> is when water doesn't move because the solute concentrations are equal.</li>
		</ul>

	<li>Compare and contrast the different passive (simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion) and active (primary, secondary) transport mechanisms</li>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Passive transport</b> requires no energy and works through diffusion, and it is moved WITH the concetration gradient.</li>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Simple diffusion</b> is the free movement of molecules through the membrane as diffusion.</li>
			<li><b>Facilitated diffusion</b> is the movement of molecules through <b>protein transporters</b>, which helps molecules get past the membrane.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Active transport</b> requires energy because it is moved AGAINST the concentration gradient. </li>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Primary active transport</b> is when the tranportation is active (IE Na-K)
			<li><b>Secondary active transport</b> is when the transportation is against the concentration gradient, but as a by-product of something else. Technically doesn't require ATP. </li>.
			</ul>
		</ul>
</ul>
</body>
