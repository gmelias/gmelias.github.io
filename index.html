<h1>Welcome to My Programming Journey</h1>

<h2>General Purpose</h2>
<p>I have created this site using GitHub, Notepad and freeCodeCamp. This website will be used to publish my progress, relevant projects, and important information. Thank you for taking the time to visit my site!</p>

<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I'm currently a college student. I've wanted to learn about programming and become a developer since I was 11 or 12, ever since I was introduced to scratch and all the games people would create. That was when I realized how powerful being a dev could be, and it was something I wanted to contribute to. But.. I had the hardest time figuring out where to start, and I didn't know anyone else in real life that I could ask questions. I finally took my first course in python about a year ago, but the education hasn't stopped since!</p>

<h2>Timeline of My Progress</h2> 
<p>I started with C/C#, but in order to get used to programming syntax and thought processes, I decided to switch to HTML and front-end development. I plan on tackling more languages in the future; this is a jumping off point. Here's what I've accomplished so far:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Basic HTML and HTML5</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Creating basic headings and paragraphs</li>
   <li>Creating HTML comments</li> <!-- Like this! -->
   <li>Adding Images</li> <!-- <img src="https://www.photo.jpg" alt="photo description"> -->
   <li>Creating forms!</li>
  </ul>
 <li>Basic CSS</li>
</ol>
